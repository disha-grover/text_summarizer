Describe the input and output \n**Input**\n* String-Input: Ask user to input text extract which needs summarization\n* Int-Input: Ask user to input max sentence length of summary\n* Yes/No: Yes if user would like to continue again to resummarize, or No if they'd like to exit the program\n\n**Output** \n* Use pypi software, specifically bert extractive summarizer (https://pypi.org/project/bert-extractive-summarizer/)\n\n# Step 3/4.
